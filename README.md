# Audio Control Center Project
This project should be working right now, but there is a know memory leak in the program that causes the program to crash after about an hour because it will not fully deallocate all of the memory when finishing thread execution

UPDATE: the memory leak was fixed, right now this application only works for windows, but it is built on the .NET MAUI framework, so feel free to fork the project and make a version working with mac or linux
